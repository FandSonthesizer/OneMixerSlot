The trimmers T101 to T104 are used to adjust the midrange for the paning for each channel.
Basically, for each channel :
use a voltmeter and adjust the trimmer in order to measure -4V on the wiper pad of the trimmer (normally you are 
very close from the optimal setting)
Then send a TRIANGLE WAVE(1kHz) with an amplitude of 10Vpp (-5V/+5V) on the input of the channel.
Set the PAN LEVEL pot to 0, and the PAN pot to 12 o'clock.
Connect a dual channel oscilloscope at the outputs. You should obtain the triangle with equal amplitude on 
both channels, then turn the PAN pot from Clockwise to Counter-clockwise position : you should observe the 
disappearing of the triangle on one side and the increase in amplitude on the other side.
Now, adjust the trimmers such that when the PAN pot is at 12 o'clock, the amplitude of the two triangle 
waves is roughly half of that can be measured for one wave when the PAN pot is set to clock-wise or 
anti-clockwise positions. (If you don't have an oscilloscope by ear using hadphones, check for an 
even balance at 12 o'clock, then verify that the panning effect acts as expected when rotating the PAN pot).
